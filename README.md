## Scala Rendering ##
This is my from-scratch 3d rendering project for Scala. Capable of stunning 50x50 pixel images showing the full detail of the two whole primitives available to be spawned, it is the cutting edge of 3D technology.

If this were about 70 years ago, anyway.

## Why? ##
The goal was simple. Learn Scala while also gaining a simple understanding of 3D graphics.

## Contents ##
From scratch, I created objects for points, vectors, rays, shapes, colors, lights, cameras, materials, and a PPM exporter to show it all off.




## sbt project cross-compiled with Scala 3 and Scala 2

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project, you can compile code with `sbt compile` and run it
with `sbt run`, `sbt console` will start a Dotty REPL. For more information on
cross-compilation in sbt, see <https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Cross-Build.html>.
